TITLE      : SharedGroup
SUMMARY    : &g_shared_group_summary
             Sharing groups between processes.
DESCR      : &g_shared_group_descr
             >
             Database files can be shared between running applications.

             When multiple threads or processes want to access the same
             database file, they must each do so through their own
             instance of SharedGroup.

             If the database file does not already exist, it will
             be created.

             While at least one instance of SharedGroup exists for
             a specific database file, a lock file will exist
             too. The lock file will be placed in the same
             directory as the database file, and its name is
             derived by adding the suffix '.lock' to the name of
             the database file.

             Processes that share a database file must reside on
             the same host.

             Moreover, the class also provides a transactional
             interface to TightDB. Transactions are divided into
             read and write transactions. While read transactions
             do not modify the table and thereby the group, write
             transactions do. This division is important to remember
             as derived objects (tables, views, etc.) are either
             writable or not.

             Read transactions are significantly faster than write
             transactions.

      DESCR    :
      - TEXT   : &g_shared_group_constructor_descr
                 >
                 Open a shared group (database will be created if it does not already exist).
                 Opening a shared group also creates a lock file in the same
                 directory as the database file. The lock file is used for cross-process
                 coordination of database access. The lock file is removed when
                 the last shared group is removed (but see below).

                 By default the shared group will be fully durable, so that
                 each commit writes its changes to disk in an atomic manner
                 that guarantees that the file is always consistent.
                 The transaction will complete when the write has been done 
                 to disk (depending on your disk, it might return when the
                 disk has received the data to it's cache).

                 You can also set the durability level to Asynchroneous.
                 This means that the actual write to disk can occur with a delay.
                 This provides much higher write performance, compared to full
                 durability. The transactions are still done atomically.
                 (Note: this mode is currently not implemented on Windows versions
                 of TightDB).

                 If your data is transient, and does not need to persist to disk
                 (like for caching or shared state between processes). You can
                 open the shared group in memory-only mode. Then the file will 
                 just be used for identification and backing; it will be removed
                 when there are no more processes using it.

                 When multiple threads or processes access the same database file
                 through shared groups, each shared group must be opened in the same
                 mode.

                 When used with asynchronous durability level, a process running
                 in the background (the "commit daemon") may continue to update
                 the database after the application has terminated. The lock file will 
                 be removed and the commit daemon will terminate once the update is
                 complete. As long as the lock file is present, new shared
                 groups can only be created with asynchronous durability level.

                 In case of abnormal termination or a machine crash, the lock file
                 may be left in an inconsistent state. Shared group tries to detect
                 and remedy this problem when it is opened, but it is not possible
                 to safely handle all scenarios. If safety cannot be ensured, shared
                 group will give up and throw a PresumablyStaleLockFile exception. 
                 In this case, the stale lock file must be removed manually. In all
                 cases the database file itself will be in a consistent state, even though
                 updates still pending at the time of crash will be lost.

                 open(const std::string& file, bool no_create = false, DurabilityLevel dlevel = durability_Full)
      DESCR    : &g_shared_group_open_descr
                 Attach this SharedGroup instance to the specified
                 database file.

                 If the database file does not already exist, it will
                 be created (unless <tt>no_create</tt> is set to
                 true.) When multiple threads are involved, it is safe
                 to let the first thread, that gets to it, create the
                 file.

                 While at least one instance of SharedGroup exists for
                 a specific database file, a "lock" file will be
                 present too. The lock file will be placed in the same
                 directory as the database file, and its name will be
                 derived by appending ".lock" to the name of the
                 database file.

                 When multiple SharedGroup instances refer to the same
                 file, they must specify the same durability level,
                 otherwise an exception will be thrown.

                 Calling open() on a SharedGroup instance that is
                 already in the attached state has undefined behavior.

                 other than open(), is_attached(), and ~SharedGroup()

                 Reserve disk space.
      DESCR    : &g_shared_group_reserve_descr
                 Reserve disk space now to avoid allocation errors at
                 a later point in time, and to minimize on-disk
                 fragmentation. In some cases, less fragmentation
                 translates into improved performance.

                 When supported by the system, a call to this function
                 will make the database file at least as big as the
                 specified size, and cause space on the target device
                 to be allocated (note that on many systems on-disk
                 allocation is done lazily by default). If the file is
                 already bigger than the specified size, the size will
                 be unchanged, and on-disk allocation will occur only
                 for the initial section that corresponds to the
                 specified size. On systems that do not support
                 preallocation, this function has no effect. To know
                 whether preallocation is supported by TightDB on your
                 platform, call File::is_prealloc_supported().

                 It is an error to call this function on an unattached
                 shared group. Doing so will result in undefined
                 behavior.
