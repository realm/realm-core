v7

The first line of this file describes the current benchmarking tool version.
It is used as a folder prefix to handle storing multiple versions of performance results.
If the functionality of the existing benchmarks changes (ie benchmark-common-tasks or benchmark-crud)
Then the version here should be bumped so that that benchmark is re-run on old versions of core again,
while still retaining the old version results. If the version is not bumped these scripts will use the
old numbers and produce misleading results for old versions.
